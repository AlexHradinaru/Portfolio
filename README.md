# Alex Grad – QA Automation Engineer Portfolio

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me  
My journey into QA started with a deep interest in how things work—and how they break. Over the years, I’ve grown into a hands-on QA engineer who enjoys building stable test frameworks, debugging tricky issues, and working closely with developers and product teams.

I love diving into automation, exploring API behavior and validating databases. Whether it’s a tight release cycle or a new product launch, I bring a proactive, detail-oriented mindset to ensure software works as expected before it reaches users.
